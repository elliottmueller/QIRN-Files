# QIRN-Files
QIRN scripts and images used for the GUI and source functions.

To install QIRN onto your computer, open the command window or terminal and use the "python3 -m venv QIRN22" command to create a virtual environment called QIRN22.
Next, activate that environment: "source QIRN22/bin/activate"
Finally, add all the necessary python packages using the command "pip install -r requirements.txt"

Now you can run QIRN's GUI by calling the QIRN_GUI.py script in the directory that has that python file.
